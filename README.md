# Back-and-forth parametric LinuxCNC Gcode.

This is a little G-code subroutine to make some particular movements on LinuxCNC dialect.

I started this because I intend to make GCode to alternated movements with in-loco manual editing, so the approach was parametric programming with setable variables and subroutines calls.

One big thanks to Joseph  by Camotics simulator, by which make the things a lot easier.

Obs.: I pretend to use big diameters (100mm) cutters tools but stumbled in this detail on simulation on Camotics. So the above image shows the correct path but not the real intenction...
