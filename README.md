# Back-and-forth parametric LinuxCNC Gcode.

This is a little G-code subroutine to make some particular movements on LinuxCNC dialect.

I started this 'cause I intend to make GCode to alternated movements with in-loco manual editing, so the approach was parametric programming with subroutines calls.

One big thanks to Joseph by Camotics tools, which make the things easier.
